      <p>
        I'm a product-driven engineer with a passion for a mixture of the
        technical, creative, and impactful. I'm a former competitive
        speed-skater and an avid runner. I'm trying to reach native fluency in
        Japanese, and in my free time love to collect vinyl, watch good films,
        and have a growing interest in fashion/art.
